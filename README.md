## Project Overview
This project was completed using this dataset <a href= "https://github.com/Rachael-Osoro/Phase_2_project/blob/main/kc_house_data.csv">King County Housing Data</a>. The dataset includes homes sold  between May 2014 and May 2015, including house properties such as number bathrooms, zipcode, langitude, latitude. Here is a brief overview of the data set <a href="https://github.com/Rachael-Osoro/Phase_2_project/blob/main/Data_Description.md"> King County Housing Description</a>
The goal of this Analysis is to predict the prices of houses in King County to enable a real estate company make data driven investment in housing as explained below.
## Business Understanding
A real estate company is looking to secure properties in King County Washington. In order to drive up itâ€™s profitability, the company is looking for a model that will predict house prices based on the information provided in <a href= "https://github.com/Rachael-Osoro/Phase_2_project/blob/main/kc_house_data.csv">King County Housing Data</a>. This will help them determine which houses to invest in and adjustments that need to be made to the properties they will acquire in order to attract clientele.

Grade, 
Square footage of the house,
Square footage of 15 neighbouring homes.
